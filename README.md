# Mealth
Mental Health is the new Wealth


This was Our ConuHacks (Hackathon | Concordia University) Project

We hosted the server on AWS and all of our templates and editing took place on AWS hence we cannot provide the source code here.

Hence only the photos are available in the pdf above.

Mealth primarily focused on Stress and Workload Pressure our community faces everyday.
We made a google assisstant by the name of Dr Mealth Pal which takes your mental stress test every 8hours and 
notifies us of your mental health , just like every other assisstant it can play songs, poems or games for you to 
refresh your mind a bit.

We provided with some services such as therapy dogs, spa sessions etc which you could opt for once your company takes our
services and we also created a system of Wollars , Work-dollars which would be given to the Mealthalete(mental athlete) of the 
month. Wollars could be redeemed for movietickets, food discounts and food vouchers etc.

We also created a CDN Network where we could see where our users were coming from, so that the company knows where the actual market is.

WE also createed a chatbot using crisp's API and dialogflow for general messages or requests to the server.
